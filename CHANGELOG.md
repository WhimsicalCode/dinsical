# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [1.011] - 2026-04-07

### Changed
- Lowercase `u`: added serifs via glyph overlay.

## [1.010] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed
- Variable font weight 500 (Medium) and 600 (SemiBold) now match the visual
  weight of the corresponding static instances and DIN Whim. Previously the
  VF linearly interpolated between the Regular and Bold masters, producing a
  stem width ~8 units lighter than intended at wght=500. Fix: add Medium and
  SemiBold as explicit VF masters in `build-ephemeral-ufos.sh` (with the same
  calibrated `interpolate-font.py` factors as the static fonts) and register
  them as sources at wght=500/600 in `Dinsical-Variable.designspace`.

## [1.009] - 2026-04-02

- Rename font family: Dinsy → Dinsical.

## [1.008] - 2026-04-02

- Italic slant angle reduced from 12° to 10° to match Dinsy. `slnt` axis range
  updated to −10–0; italic instances placed at −10. Applied via
  `tools/copy-missing-italics.py` and `tools/build-ephemeral-ufos.sh`.

## [1.007] - 2026-04-02

- Fix vertical alignment vs DIN Whim in CSS layouts.
  Root cause: Chromium respects `USE_TYPO_METRICS` for TTF/variable fonts
  (uses sTypo asc=750) but falls back to hhea for CFF/OTF static fonts
  (uses hhea asc=830). DIN Whim is CFF, so its effective CSS ascender is
  830; Dinsy (TTF variable) was using 750 — placing the baseline 13 px
  higher at 160 px font-size, causing visible vertical shift.
  Fix: set `sTypo` ascender/descender to match `hhea` (830/−170/200).
  Both tables now agree so the browser gets the same baseline regardless
  of which metric path it takes. `line-height: normal` is unchanged (still
  1.2× font-size: 830+170+200=1200 units).
- Tuned `WDTH_BLEND` from 0.28 to 0.20 (wdth 107 → 105) after visual review.
- Width blend: `tools/derive-sources.py` now interpolates the Dinsy (wdth=100)
  masters toward DINishExpanded by `WDTH_BLEND=0.20` before UPM scaling.
  This corresponds to approximately wdth=105 on the 75–125 axis, matching
  DIN Whim letterform ink widths. Implemented via `_blend_roots()` (blends
  all outline points, advances, component offsets, anchors, and PS hints).
- Spacing patch mechanism: `overlay/spacing-patch.py` is now applied by
  `tools/derive-sources.py` after every `make sources` run, so Dinsy-specific
  sidebearing changes survive upstream DINish updates automatically.
- Set sidebearings for ~50 base glyphs (a–z, A–Z, punctuation) to match
  DIN Whim's exact LSB/RSB values. Propagated automatically to ~190 composite
  glyphs (accented Latin, Cyrillic variants) via advance-width and
  combining-mark xOffset update.

## [1.006] - 2026-04-02

- Kern patch mechanism: `overlay/kern-patch.py` is now applied by
  `tools/derive-sources.py` after every `make sources` run, so Dinsy-specific
  kern changes survive upstream DINish updates automatically.
- Added complete Y kerning group (~26 pairs) — upstream DINish has none;
  Y. −96, Y- −92, Ya/c/d/e/g/o/q/s −56–−58, Yu −48, Yz −46, Yv/w/y −28,
  YJ −82, YA −59, Y:/; −53, Yx −43.
- Reduced L over-kerning: L+hyphen −133→−24, L+v/w/y −93→−34/−30/−16,
  L+V −103→−60, L+W −71→−36, L+T −117→−90, L+U −55→−30, L+Y −109→−90,
  L+round-UC −40→−30.
- Removed L+LC kern extras (L+a/b/c/d/e/g/h/i/k/l/m/n/o/p/q/r/u) —
  DIN Whim does not kern L before lowercase letters.
- Comma/period separation: removed `\comma` from kern classes; DIN Whim
  never kerns before commas. Period values adjusted: F −141→−100, P −115→−140,
  T −80→−98, U −40→−21, V −70→−90, W −57→−60.
- Added missing J pairs: TJ −96, PJ −79, VJ −66, FJ −59, WJ −55, YJ −82.
- Split round-LC kern group into open-bowl (c/e/o) and closed-bowl (d/g/q):
  T+c/e/o=−66, T+d/q=−40, T+g=0; F+c/e/o=−42, F+d/g/q=−14;
  K+c/e/o=−11, K+d/g/q=−8.
- Removed T/F/V/W/K + straight-LC kern extras (DIN Whim has none).
- Added T+m/u −54, F+m/u −24/−30 (previously lumped with straight-LC at −12).
- T value corrections: v/w/y −61→−48, A −79→−72, a −84→−72, s −73→−50,
  x −61→−37, colon/semi −40→−20, round-UC −31→−24.
- Removed Z+d/g/q/a extras; reduced Z+c/e/o −36→−18.
- Fixed hyphen+V −40→−64, hyphen+Y −72→−92.
- Fixed X+round-UC −17→−7.
- Fixed kern-compare extraction script to respect Format-1 subtable precedence
  over Format-2 class rules (first-match-wins), matching layout engine behaviour.

## [1.005] - 2026-04-02

- Calibrated weight axis to match DIN Whim stem weights — Regular, Medium, and Bold now have
  identical I-glyph stem widths to their DIN Whim counterparts (89 / 118 / 147 units at 1000 UPM).
  Previously DIN Whim Bold ≈ old Dinsy Heavy in visual weight.
- Weight interpolation changed from linear `(weight−4)/3` to a piecewise-linear calibration
  anchored at Regular (factor 0.298), Medium (0.807), Bold (1.316).

## [1.004] - 2026-04-02

- Restored `wdth` axis (75–100–125) in variable font, adding Condensed and Expanded variants.
  Condensed and Expanded are derived on-the-fly from upstream DINish during the build.

## [1.003] - 2026-04-02

- Flattened `fonts/` directory — files moved from `fonts/{fmt}/Dinsy/Dinsy-*.{fmt}` to `fonts/{fmt}/Dinsy-*.{fmt}`
- Variable font renamed from `Dinsy[slnt,wght]` to `Dinsy-Var`

## [1.002] - 2026-04-02

## [1.001] - 2026-04-02

## [1.000] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- Initial release.
- UPM: 1024 → 1000 (exact 120 px line height at 100 px font-size)
- Line metrics: match DIN Whim (hhea 830/−170/200, sTypo 750/−250/200, win 850/350)
- Glyph scale: ×0.985 to match DIN Whim visual glyph size
- Variable font: `wght` (300–900) + `slnt` (0–−12) axes
- Upstream DINish: playbeing/dinish @ `a5f3b2a3b932` (v4.006)
